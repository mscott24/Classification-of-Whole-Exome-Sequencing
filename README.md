Title: Classification of Genomic Variants from Whole Exome Sequencing with Machine Learning

Abstract
Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) allows for the in depth investigation of cancer
genomes. As whole genome sequencing transitions from research environment to
clinical and industrial environment, one major challenge current sequencing tools
are facing is the low accuracy in identifying true gene mutation in low coverage data.
Using features extracted from established bioinformatics workflows, we implement
a classifier to distinguish true mutations from false positives in a downsampled,
low coverage dataset. Leveraging the advances that have been made in recent years
in the field of machine learning, we implement two sets of classification algorithms
to solve this problem. We implement both a soft-margin support vector machine
(SVM) and a tuned random forest (RF) algorithm. Accuracy for both methods
reached >95%.
